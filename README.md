# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Ã’rla Walsh

## Overview.

The concept of this application is for users to add reviews about their favourite beauty products. The users can input their data about the products and then it displays in a table when they submit it. Users can then choose to edit, update, cancel or deleted the desired review. Users can also search for a certain review on a certain product. Users also have the option to filter the reviews and search results either by alphabetically or by price.

List of user features:
 + Create product review
 + Edit product review
 + Update product review
 + Cancel deleting product review
 + Delete product review
 + Diplay prodcut review in a list

## Routing.
+ / - displays all product reviews.
+ /about - diplays details about the review page.
+ /contact - displays details about how to contact the developer.

## Extra features

Users can search for a product review and they can also filter for reviews alphabetically or by price.

## Independent learning.
I tried to implement a user registration and login in but I wasn't fully able to implement these features due to the lack of resourses available on the internet and the timeframe. I have gained a reasonable understanding of React from completing this assignment.
